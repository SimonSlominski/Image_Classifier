## Image Classifier based on MobileNet and TensorFlow.js


This is a simple image classifier using TensorFlow.js. Using your webcam you can train model and save various objects into classes so that model automaticly classify this object later. 

This image classifier was created by following the Google TensorFlow.js Image Classifier Tutorial and added some bootstrap to make the app responsive.
